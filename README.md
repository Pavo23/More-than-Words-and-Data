# Abstract

The internet is celebrated as a vast network that connects computers and people all around the world. Unfortunately, this connectivity comes with a price. Cybertip.ca alone processed [4.3 million](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-safety-canada/campaigns/online-child-sexual-exploitation/infographic-online-child-sexual-exploitation.html) online sexual child exploitation reports between 
2014-2020. This research project examines the hypothesis that the type of high frequency words in online grooming chats with minors reveals a predator’s conversational strategy. Sexual child exploitation has not just become a prevalent issue with the beginning of the internet age. A historical timeline was created to visually illustrate that this form of child abuse has been part of the societal fabric since “the beginning of time”. The hypothesis was tested by using four chat log transcripts from the website [Perverted-Justice.com](http://www.perverted-justice.com). These were visually displayed with [Voyant Tools](http://voyant-tools.org/) and compared. The results show that words of agreement (yea, yes, ok, okay, ya, cool) or words expressing a preference (like, want) are the
 most frequently used words in the grooming chat logs with presumed 13/14-year-old teenage girls. This finding suggests that the conversational strategy of a sexual predator is above all to cre-ate an environment of constant compliance and agreement for their desires.

# Introduction
[Bethany Nowviskie](https://nowviskie.org/2014/anthropocene/)  (2014) uses, in a conference talk she prepared for Digital Humanities 2014, the deep and shallow ends of a swimming pool as a metaphor for time. When we look at both ends of the sexual child exploitation “pool”, we come to realize that this issue is not a new phenomenon. It was prevalent even in [Ancient Greece](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-78440-3_52). In general, life from antiquity until now has changed dramatically, but the core issue of sexual child abuse has been a constant companion [throughout time](https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=13PwFNj2K0MsZOgHJLD6iyPa8Sc1cAz_0u-0_VDSp3-c&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650). This research project will focus on challenges that have come with the internet age, and more specifically it will analyze if frequently used words in online grooming chats can reveal a pedophile’s conversational strategy. Chat log transcripts from Perverted-Justice.com are used as data sets. Perverted-Justice is a not-for-profit organization, which works in conjunction with law enforcement, to convict internet predators. Adult volunteers of this community pose as minors in chat rooms to lure pedophiles. Their efforts have been credited with [623 cyber predators'](http://www.perverted-justice.com) convictions to date. These chats have been transcribed and made available to the public and are used for research purposes. The linguistic properties of the Perverted Justice dataset have been investigated in several studies.  [Black et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25613089/) use the data for a linguistic analysis of grooming strategies of online child sex offenders. [Chiu et al.](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-29667-013) (2018) create a statistical discourse analysis of self-disclosure and emotion words of online sexual offenders in chats with minors, and [Egan et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47867576_Perverted_Justice_A_Content_Analysis_of_the_Language_Used_by_Offenders_Detected_Attempting_to_Solicit_Children_for_Sex) (2011) produce a content analysis of the language used by offenders attempting to solicit children for sex. This project wants to add to these discussions.
